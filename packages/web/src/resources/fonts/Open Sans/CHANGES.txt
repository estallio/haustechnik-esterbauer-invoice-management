The original .ttf files in addition to the LICENSE.txt
file were downloaded from Google Fonts and afterwards
converted to woff2 fonts. The documentation is only
necessary for the woff2 files in this folder as these
are the only files that falls under the Apache License.
The stylesheet.css is created on my own and falls under
